This is my powershell custom user-profile, feel free to copy and modify for own usage.
I have used some packages like oh-my-posh(themes), PSFzf(command line search), Terminal-Icons( for displaying some fancy icons in my terminal), and posh-git.
There are some pre-requisites to be followed - 
1. Ensure you have powershell 7 installed as this config is for pwsh 7.
2. Use any patched Nerd Font available to display icons properly as Terminal font.
3. Powershell 7 should be set as default terminal application.
